<h1>Day 18 of the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</h1>
<p>For the Day 18 challenge, I recreated Damien Hirst's Spots painting (which features a series of evenly spaced dots of seemingly random colours. This is a culmination of the teaching points that were shared in the tutorial, including the following but not limited to</p>
<ul>
  <li>Object Oriented Programming, using Turtle, Screen and Colorgram classes</li>
  <li>Tuples</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why am I doing this?</h2>
<p>I have learned python before in school but I hope to revisit some of the python concepts that I may have forgotten and at the same time delve further into python, especially in the field of data science and visualisation.</p>

<h2>You can join me too!</h2>
